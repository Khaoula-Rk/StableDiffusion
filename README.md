## 🎨 Text-to-Image Generation with Stable Diffusion

### 🔍 Project Description
This project explores visual synthesis using generative AI models to create realistic images from textual descriptions. 🖼️ We studied and compared several image generation models, including DALL-E, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion, to understand their architectures and use cases. The practical implementation was carried out and tested using Stable Diffusion.

### 🚀 Features
- Generates high-quality images from text prompts.
- Uses the Hugging Face diffusers library.
- Supports hyperparameter tuning (guidance scale, inference steps, etc.) for optimal results.
- Implements key components such as Autoencoder, CLIPTextModel, and UNet.

### 📊 Skills Developed
- 🤖 In-depth understanding of image generation models (DALL-E, Imagen, Stable Diffusion).
- ✍️ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for extracting features from text descriptions.
- 📚 Advanced usage of AI libraries, such as Diffusers and Transformers.
- ⚡ Optimization of diffusion models for specific applications.
